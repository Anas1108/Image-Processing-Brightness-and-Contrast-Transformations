# Image Processing - Brightness and Contrast Transformations

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of different brightness and contrast transformations that can be applied to images, including Log and Inverse Log transform, Power law nth power and nth root, and Power Law transformation.

## Log and Inverse Log Transform
The log transformation is used to increase the brightness values in an image, resulting in a more evenly distributed image with enhanced contrast. The inverse log transform reduces the brightness values, giving the image a darker appearance.

## Power law nth power and nth root
The nth power transformation increases the brightness values of an image, enhancing the contrast. A greater value of n results in a higher increase in brightness and contrast. The nth root transformation reduces the brightness values and decreases the contrast, where a smaller value of n results in a greater reduction in brightness and contrast.

## Power Law Transformation
The power law transformation can be used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an image. The parameter C in the transformation formula controls the overall brightness, where a higher value of C results in a brighter image. The parameter gamma controls the contrast, where a higher value of gamma results in a greater increase in contrast and a lower value of gamma results in a decrease in contrast.

## Usage
The code in this repository can be run to apply these transformations to an input image and display the results. The effects of varying the parameters C and gamma can be observed by changing their values in the code and re-running the transformations.

## Conclusion
The effects of different variables, such as C and gamma, on the output of the image vary for each transformation method and depend on the desired outcome. Experimenting with different values is necessary to achieve the desired result. This repository provides a foundation for understanding and exploring brightness and contrast transformations in image processing.
